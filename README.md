Final Group Assignment Instructions:

1. Project Requirements
Build a web app with a frontend and backend.
Use these tools:
Frontend: React + TypeScript
Backend: Node.js + Express
Database: your choice (for example, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL)
The app must have a login system. The login should have a purpose (for example: saving user history, or letting an admin add products).

2. Teamwork
Decide together what kind of app you want to build.
Example ideas:
Online shop with user history
Admin system for adding products
Task manager with personal tasks
Assign clear roles in your group (for example: frontend, backend, database, project lead).

3. Technical Setup
Organize your project into two folders:
frontend
backend
Use a database and connect it to your backend.
Make sure your app looks professional and is easy to use.

4. GitHub Rules
Use one main GitHub repository for your group.
Each person should work on their own branch.
Write clear commit messages.
Use pull requests to merge code.

5. Security
Use a .env file for sensitive info (like passwords and API keys).
Add .env and node_modules to your .gitignore file so they are not uploaded to GitHub.

6. Checklist
 Frontend works
 Backend works and connects to the database
 Login system works
 Sensitive info is in .env files (not on GitHub)
 Code is organized and commented
