💬 Reflections
Overall, the group has demonstrated strong communication and collaboration throughout the project. Each member took clear ownership of their responsibilities, and everyone contributed in a structured and helpful manner. The use of Trello and regular meetings helped ensure that tasks were followed up and prioritized effectively.

One of the challenges we encountered was related to timely access to the database. This caused some delays in connecting the frontend and backend, particularly for features involving data persistence, such as admin product management and customer profiles. Despite this, the team adapted well, and workarounds were implemented to keep progress moving forward until the database was fully available.
